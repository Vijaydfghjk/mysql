  database user name is Vijay
  pwd Vijay@123


1.

create database myfile;
use myfile;
create table users(
  ID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  NAME VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  AGE INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY(ID)
);

show tables;
describe users;

2. adding new column an EXISTING  table 

  alter table users add Gender varchar(10) Not null  after age;

3. adding multiple column in table:

    alter table users 
     add city varchar(12) not null,
     add contact varchar(50) not null;
describe USERES;

4. modifying the column :

    alter table users modify contact varchar(25) not null;
    ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY COLUMN column_name new_column_definition;
    
     
  **multiple column 

       alter table users
    -> modify city varchar(15) not null,
    -> modify Gender varchar(8)not null;

5. table name changing.

   alter table users rename to students;

6. Insert value into table 

   insert into students values(null,'Vijay',25,'Male','Bangalore','8838578705');
    insert into students (Name,age,Gender,City,contact) values ('Ram',28,'Male','Bangalore',9876543210); // Id auto increment

   *** Multiple value **

      insert into students (Name,age,gender,city,contact)values
      ('Mohan',26,'Male','Chennai','7012346789'),('Sheela',22,'Female','Chennai','7012346789');

7. Delete from the databse;

    delete from students where id =4;

8. Update querry;

     update students  set city = 'Madurai', contact = '8090768910',age = 25 where id=2;
      update students set name ='Leela'where id =19;

9. Truncate 

    truncate table students; -> Removed the all the data.


    Permanently Deletes Data: Yes, TRUNCATE permanently removes all rows from a table. Once they're gone, there's no built-in    way to retrieve them through MySQL itself.

   Faster Than DELETE: This is generally true, as TRUNCATE doesn't perform row-by-row logging or enforce constraints.

10.

   select name,age from students;
    printing name and age.

   select name,age,gender from students where gender ='male';

11.


Using and operator  city should be New York and who are all have age more than 23.

Logical operator.

1.select name,age,city from students where city ='New York' And age>23;

2.select name,age from students where age>30;

 get who are all have age more than 30.

 3.select name,city from students where city='New York' OR city ='chicago';

 4.select name,city,age from students where (city='New York' or city='chicago') and age>25;

 5. select name,age,city from students where (city='New York'OR city='chicago') And age>25 order by city;
     city print order by.
 6. select name,age,city from students order by city;



12 .

 select city from students - students is table name 

  printing the all the city 


select distinct city from students;

  this will print only unique of the city.

 select count(city) from students;

     this will count the number of city. 

 select count(distinct city) from students;

     This will print unique of the city.

mysql> select count(distinct city) as total from students;

as total this customize total and number unique city.


 select * from students limit 1,5;  5 means 5 records.

     This will print first 5 records

 select * from students order by id desc limit 0,1;

        des - descending coming from last 

 select max(age) from students; // getting the highest age 
 select avg(age) from students; getting the average value 

  if we get in float 51.5 we can make round

 select Round (avg(age),0) from students; // we don't get .23 something.

select sum(age) from students; // caculate all age.


 select gender,count(id) from students group by gender; // for finding male and female   count.
 select city,gender,count(id) from students group by city,gender;



13. 
    For filtering the first starting name like Ra
 select name from students where name like 'Ra%'; 


  select name from students where name like '%i';

   For filtering the last ending name like i.


  select * from students where city ='chennai' or city ='goa';  and  select * from students where city in('Goa','chennai');

  both are same.


 select * from students where city Not in('Goa','chennai') -> it will ignore the this two city.

   not - will ingore.
  select name from students where name not like 'Ra%';


 select name,age from students where age>24 and age<30;

   print only 25 to 29


 select name,age from students where age between 24 and 30;

   print starting from 24 to 30 

select name,age from students where age not between 24 and 30;

  print aprt from 24 to 30.


  if conditionn in mysql 

 count(if(astatus ='p',1,null)) as present from Attendaence group by id;

 if  astatus = p means it will print 1 and else null.



14. Joins

 inner join 
  select * from salary;
select Emp.Name,Emp.design, salary.sdate,salary.amt from Emp inner join salary 
on Emp.id = salary.id;


15. when case

select name,city, (

case 
 when city = 'Bangalore' then 400
 when city = 'chennai' then 350
 when city = 'Goa' then 100
end
